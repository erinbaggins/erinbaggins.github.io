      <p>We believe in delicious, high quality coffee and we believe you deserve a comfortable and cozy place to enjoy it. Rainy Cafe is open 7 days a week, so come by rain or shine and make yourself at home! We work with local bakeries and coffee roasters to provide you with an authentic taste of Seattle in a welcoming atmosphere. Wednesdays through Sundays we host a variety of entertainment, but our quiet reading rooms are always available any night of the week. Bring your own book or choose from one from our ever growing library.
